This is a simple application for tracking debtors loans

### Core Features of the MVP
- Register debtors to the system
- View and print the repayment statement
- Update their debts when they repay
- View total amount of money given out
- Total amount of money repaid back
- Total interest of money repaid

### Technologies Used
The app is working with a json-server as it's backend
To run it, you need to install json-server
```npm install json-server -g```
then run it 
``` json-server --watch db.json ```

### Future Developement
- Redo it using React
- Add a ruby backend with postgresql database
- Have a module for debtors to monitor their loan repayment
